# RainFall

## Useful stuff:

### 1. Tools :
- gdb (yeah)
- [peda](https://github.com/longld/peda) : makes gdb a lot easier to understand and adds some pretty handy functions, such as pattern creating and searching, and shellcode generation
- [ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) : powerful disassembler and decompiler
- [IDA](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware.shtml) : alternative to ghidra (easier to use imo) but the free version does not contain a decompiler AFAIK. still very useful to understand machine code
- python : makes it very easy to write payloads with the "print" function
